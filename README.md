This is a simple "list" app demostration that also uses Firebase auth. The basic gist is the user logs in using the super secret username and password. Then, once in the app, they can read, write, edit and delete items in a list.

Fun fact: since the app is wrapped in the Firebase auth, you'll need the username and password to access, so you'll have to reach out and ask me directly if you want to demo the app. :)
